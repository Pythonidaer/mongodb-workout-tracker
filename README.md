## Description 
>*Learning about JSON/BSON-oriented NoSQL language MongoDB, a well as its ODM/ORM Mongoose, which provides us structures and models to data that would otherwise lack structure.*

*This assignment is incomplete. I will be working on this during off days of React before Project 3.*

## Installation 
These aren't perfect instructions. First, git clone this repo onto your computer. There are many pre-requisites, including a local MongoDB instance, or the usage (and understanding thereof) of MongoDB Atlas, their cloud version. Next up, you will also need Heroku available locally, or in the least have a Heroku account. 

If you git clone and have the above pre-requisites satisfied, first `cd` into the directory and `npm install`. This will import the package.json, mainly nodemon, morgan, mongoose, mongojs, express, and dotenv.

Reading the mongoose/mongojs documentation on npmjs.com should give you an idea how to setup your connection string. I highly recommend trying to get this project to work locally before deploying it to Heroku, because deployment is an entire beast of a pain in the ass in itself.

Feel free to reach out via email if you have any questions or issues.

-----------

## Usage 
You are free to use this for learning purposes. The idea is not my own save for the routes that combine express with moongoose models. This was a homework for Trilogy Full Stack Developer coding bootcamp associated with the University of New Hampshire.

## License 
This project was created under the MIT License.

## Contributing 
I am not looking for contributors, but please reach out to me if you are looking for contributors on projects. I may be able to help out with HTML/CSS/JavaScript or perhaps some debugging, or issues deploying. Highly recommend the docs, googling terminal errors, and searching for your exact question on google, stack overflow, via twitter code community, etc. But reach out if you're stumped, I don't bite :)

-----------

## Tests 
There are no tests for this.
1. Read the package.json
2. `node seeds/seed.js` to fill your database with some samples

If at this point you are unable to get the project up and running, feel free to reach out.
